Here you'll find the notebook with the ANN, that calculates the friction factor when you put your relative roughness (you need to multiply by 1000), and your Reynolds number
(it has to be >3000, and you have to divide by 1000).
The ANN is in development,that's the reason why in the final graph you have those deviations.
